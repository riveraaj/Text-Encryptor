* Resume

This is the first Challenge of the ONE - Oracle Next Education program. This application has the function of encrypting and decoding text messages in a simple way. With the aim of exchanging information with other people in a safe and fun way.

* The encryption "keys" that we will use are the following:

      La letra "e" es convertida para "enter"
      La letra "i" es convertida para "imes"
      La letra "a" es convertida para "ai"
      La letra "o" es convertida para "ober"
      La letra "u" es convertida para "ufat"
      
* Requirements:
  - It should work only with lowercase letters
  - Do not use letters with accents or special characters
  - It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version also to return an encrypted word to its original version.

  For example:
  "cat" => "gaitober"
  gaitober" => "cat"

  - The page must have fields for insertion of the text that will be encrypted or decrypted, the user having to choose between the two options.
  - The result should be displayed on the screen.
 
* Additional characteristics:

  - A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text for the transfer section, that is, it has the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option in the applications     menu.
